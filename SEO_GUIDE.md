- Points to your sitemap

### 2. **Created sitemap.xml**
- Comprehensive XML sitemap with all your pages
- Prioritizes homepage (priority: 1.0)

### 4. **Improved Semantic HTML**

- Canonical URLs added

### 5. **De-indexed Legal Pages**

## Next Steps You Should Take

### CRITICAL - Submit to Google Search Console
1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Add property: `wgtnews.live`
3. Verify ownership (use HTML tag method or DNS)
4. Submit your sitemap: `https://wgtnews.live/sitemap.xml`
5. Request indexing for your homepage

### Submit Sitemap to Bing
1. Go to https://www.bing.com/webmasters
2. Add your site
3. Submit sitemap

### Get SSL Certificate (HTTPS)
- This is CRUCIAL for SEO in 2025
- Use Let's Encrypt (free) or your hosting provider
- Google heavily favors HTTPS sites
- Once done, the .htaccess will auto-redirect to HTTPS

### Build Backlinks
1. Get listed in NZ directories:
   - NZ Herald community links
   - Wellington directories
   - Local business listings
2. Share on social media regularly
3. Comment on other NZ news sites with your site link
4. Guest posts on NZ blogs

### Content is King
- Update daily with fresh Wellington/NZ content
- Use "Wellington" and "New Zealand" frequently in articles
- Local stories rank better than international ones
- Update your sitemap.xml when you add new articles

### Fix Domain Authority Issues
Your .live domain is hurting you. Here's why:
- Google trusts .co.nz and .nz more for NZ searches
- .live is seen as less authoritative
- **SOLUTION**: Get wellingtontimes.co.nz and redirect wgtnews.live to it
- Or at least get a .co.nz that redirects TO wgtnews.live

### Technical Quick Wins
1. Speed test your site: https://pagespeed.web.dev/
2. Fix any speed issues
3. Optimize all images (compress them)
4. Add more internal links between articles

### Track Your Progress
1. Install Google Analytics
2. Monitor rankings with tools like:
   - Google Search Console
   - Ahrefs (paid)
   - Ubersuggest (free tier)

## Keywords You Should Focus On
- "Wellington news"
- "Wellington Times"
- "wgtnews.live"
- "Wellington newspaper"
- "New Zealand news Wellington"
- "Wellington independent news"
- "Wellington journalism"

## Expected Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Google crawls your new sitemap
- **Week 3-4**: Homepage starts appearing in results
- **Month 2-3**: Should see "wellington times" ranking on page 1
- **Month 3-6**: Build authority, move up rankings

## Why You're Currently #4
1. **Domain age**: You're new (2025)
2. **Domain extension**: .live vs .co.nz
3. **No backlinks yet**: Need other sites linking to you
4. **Legal pages were ranking**: Now fixed with noindex
5. **Less optimized meta tags**: Now fixed

## Most Important Action
**GET SSL CERTIFICATE NOW** - This is non-negotiable for SEO in 2025. Google will not rank HTTP sites well.
