            <div class="article-body">
                <p class="lead"><em>Wellington, 24 October 2025</em> - While Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was touting New Zealand's trade relationships and economic credentials at the EU Business Summit in Brussels, back home the economic data tells a starkly different story.</p>

                <img src="../img/x-post.png" alt="Luxon's X post from Brussels" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 25px auto; display: block; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);">

                <p>Luxon's social media post claiming National is "focused on boosting trade and investment to grow the economy, create jobs and lift wages" would be laughable if the situation weren't so serious. The numbers paint a picture of an economy in freefall - one of the worst-performing in the developed world.</p>

                <h2>The Brutal Numbers</h2>
                
                <p>New Zealand's GDP crashed 1% in the September 2024 quarter, following a revised 1.1% fall in the June quarter - the deepest recession outside of COVID since 1991. While the Prime Minister was glad-handing European business leaders, GDP per capita back home fell for the eighth consecutive quarter.</p>

                <p><strong>Let that sink in. Eight straight quarters of declining living standards for everyday New Zealanders.</strong></p>

                <div style="background: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #d32f2f; padding: 20px; margin: 25px 0; border-radius: 4px;">
                    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.7; font-weight: bold; color: #c62828;">
                        GDP per capita was 2.5% lower in mid-2024 than a year earlier, and on an annual basis, per capita GDP was 2.7% smaller in September 2024. That's not economic management - that's economic malpractice.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>Worst in the OECD</h2>

                <p>While Luxon brags about trade being "up $12 billion since we came into government," he conveniently ignores that New Zealand is one of the worst-performing economies in the OECD.</p>

                <p>Among 28 OECD countries with available data, only five recorded GDP contractions in 2024 - and New Zealand was firmly in that unfortunate club. While the OECD overall recorded modest growth of 0.4-0.5% in recent quarters, New Zealand was going backwards at an alarming rate.</p>

                <div class="info-box" style="background: #f5f5f5; padding: 25px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 30px 0;">
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; font-size: 18px;">ðŸ“Š How NZ Compares to Peers (Recent Quarters)</h3>
                    <ul style="line-height: 1.9; margin: 15px 0; list-style: none; padding: 0;">
                        <li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;"><strong>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ United States:</strong> +0.7% growth</li>
                        <li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;"><strong>ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ India:</strong> +1.1% growth</li>
                        <li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;"><strong>ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australia:</strong> +0.3% growth</li>
                        <li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;"><strong>ðŸ“ˆ OECD Average:</strong> +0.4-0.5% growth</li>
                        <li style="padding: 8px 0; font-weight: bold; color: #d32f2f;"><strong>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ New Zealand:</strong> -1.0% contraction</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Compare that to our peers: The United States maintained stable growth at 0.7% in Q3, India grew 1.1%, and even Australia managed 0.3%. Meanwhile, New Zealand was in the midst of what economists have described as an economic catastrophe.</p>

                <h2>The Real Cost</h2>

                <p>Kiwibank's chief economist called it "effectively a recession that's lasted two years," noting the economy has recorded a "triple trough in economic activity."</p>

                <p>The construction and manufacturing sectors lost over 18,000 filled jobs in 2024. So much for "creating jobs."</p>

                <div style="background: #fff3e0; padding: 20px; margin: 25px 0; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #ff9800;">
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 0; font-size: 16px; color: #f57c00;">ðŸ’¼ Job Losses & Economic Pain</h3>
                    <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin: 10px 0;">
                        <li><strong>18,000+</strong> jobs lost in construction and manufacturing in 2024</li>
                        <li><strong>4.8%</strong> projected unemployment rate for 2025 (OECD)</li>
                        <li><strong>Highest household debt servicing costs</strong> since 2011</li>
                        <li><strong>8 consecutive quarters</strong> of declining GDP per capita</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>The OECD projects New Zealand's unemployment rate to reach 4.8% in 2025, and household debt servicing costs have hit their highest levels since 2011, squeezing families already struggling with the cost of living.</p>

                <h2>Missing the Point</h2>

                <p>The Prime Minister's focus on the EU-NZ Free Trade Agreement supporting "Kiwi businesses to grow" might be worthwhile in the long term, but it's cold comfort to the thousands losing their jobs right now, the families struggling with mortgage payments, and the young people watching their economic prospects evaporate.</p>

                <p>The OECD itself has been critical, noting that spending overruns contributed to New Zealand having "one of the largest increases in public debt-to-GDP ratio" in the OECD, increasing by 16 percentage points between 2019 and 2023.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>A Leadership Vacuum</h2>

                <p>As New Zealand's economy contracts at rates not seen in over three decades, Luxon jets off to Brussels to take photo opportunities and talk about being a "trusted partner" to Europe. Meanwhile, activity in interest-rate sensitive sectors like construction continues to slow, business investment is shrinking, and private consumption would be falling without high population growth masking the decline.</p>

                <p>The disconnect between the Prime Minister's rhetoric and the economic reality facing New Zealanders couldn't be starker. Trade may be up $12 billion, but if you're one of the 18,000 who lost your manufacturing or construction job, if your real income has fallen for two years straight, or if you're part of the growing number who can't afford rent or mortgage payments, those boasts ring pretty hollow.</p>

                <div style="background: #f5f5f5; border: 3px solid #d32f2f; padding: 25px; margin: 30px 0; border-radius: 8px; text-align: center;">
                    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.6; font-weight: bold; color: #d32f2f;">
                        New Zealand deserves better than spin from Brussels while the economy burns at home.
