            <p class="image-caption">The Batanes Islands in the northern Philippines, less than 90 miles from Taiwan, have become a frontline in the US-China military competition</p>

            <div class="article-body">
                <p class="lead"><strong>BATANES, Philippines</strong> — In the emerald waters less than 90 miles from Taiwan, a strategic transformation is quietly reshaping the balance of power in our Pacific neighbourhood. The Bashi Channel, a narrow waterway between the northern Philippines and Taiwan, has become the focal point of an intensifying military competition that could have profound implications for New Zealand and the wider Pacific region.</p>

                <p>When Marilyn Hubalde first heard military helicopters thundering over her island home in April 2023, she thought war had arrived. The 65-year-old store owner in Batanes province watched as Filipino and American troops descended on her community of 20,000 people for amphibious warfare exercises. Her helper, working in the fields, was so terrified she hid in the woods until nightfall, convinced the conflict with China had already begun.</p>

                <p>Since that initial shock, these remote Philippine islands have become accustomed to something quite extraordinary: an almost permanent state of military preparation. What was once a peaceful backwater has been transformed into a frontline position in the great power competition between the United States and China, with implications that ripple across the entire Pacific region, including to our shores in New Zealand.</p>

                <h2>Understanding the Strategic Prize</h2>

                <p>To grasp why this matters, we need to understand the geography. The Bashi Channel sits at a critical junction, connecting the South China Sea with the Western Pacific Ocean. Think of it as a maritime gateway that Chinese naval forces would need to pass through to operate freely in the broader Pacific. For Beijing's rapidly expanding navy, access to this waterway isn't just convenient—it's potentially essential for projecting power beyond its coastal waters.</p>

                <p>The Philippines, with its more than 7,600 islands, forms a crucial segment of what strategists call the "First Island Chain." This natural barrier runs from Japan through Taiwan and the Philippines down to Borneo, essentially forming a fence that contains China's naval forces within its coastal seas. As Rear Admiral Roy Trinidad of the Philippine Navy aptly puts it: "By divine design, we have been put here. We are the toll gate between the South China Sea and the Pacific Ocean."</p>

                <h2>A Permanent American Presence Returns</h2>

                <p>What Reuters' investigation reveals is striking in its scope. More than three decades after the Philippines ordered American forces to leave the sprawling Subic Bay naval base in 1992, ending nearly a century of U.S. military presence, American troops have quietly returned in force. But this time, rather than occupying permanent bases, they're rotating through the archipelago in what amounts to a continuous presence through joint training exercises and deployments.</p>

                <p>The scale is remarkable. When Philippine Armed Forces Chief General Romeo Brawner met with U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo in Hawaii this August, they agreed to more than 500 joint military engagements for 2026 alone. These range from large-scale combat exercises to smaller expert exchanges, creating a web of military cooperation that keeps American forces constantly present in the Philippines.</p>

                <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed to Congress in June that modernising capabilities to "deny Chinese aggression in the First Island chain" was a priority for the Trump administration. The scale and duration of joint training with the Philippines, he noted, was increasing substantially.</p>

                <h2>The Missile Strategy</h2>

                <p>The heart of this military preparation involves sophisticated anti-ship missile systems. During exercises in April and again in May and June of this year, American forces airlifted compact NMESIS (Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System) launchers to Batanes. These systems fire Naval Strike Missiles with a range exceeding 300 kilometres, capable of threatening any warship attempting to transit the Bashi Channel or operate in the seas around Taiwan.</p>

                <p>As Admiral Trinidad explained to Reuters with admirable directness: the missile "is designed to close a strait." From positions in Batanes, these weapons could strike at Chinese naval forces attempting to invade Taiwan or impose a blockade on the island. They could also deny Chinese warships access to the broader Pacific Ocean, where Beijing would need to operate to counter any American or Japanese intervention in a Taiwan crisis.</p>

                <p>Retired General Emmanuel Bautista, former chief of staff of the Philippine Armed Forces, framed the strategic calculation starkly: "The invasion of Taiwan is almost impossible if you don't control the northern Philippines."</p>

                <p>The U.S. has also deployed its powerful Typhon missile system to Luzon island, just south of Batanes. Armed with Tomahawk missiles with a range of at least 1,600 kilometres, these weapons could strike targets deep inside Chinese territory. Beijing has angrily demanded their removal, calling the deployment "very dangerous."</p>

                <h2>China's Response and Rising Tensions</h2>

                <p>China's reaction to these developments has been forceful on multiple fronts. Beijing has intensified what military analysts call "gray-zone" warfare—aggressive actions that stop just short of open conflict. Chinese coastguard and naval vessels have been harassing Philippine law enforcement ships, military patrols, and fishing boats, particularly in the South China Sea but increasingly around Batanes as well. In early August, the Philippine Navy detected and challenged multiple unauthorised Chinese naval and coastguard ships near the northern islands.</p>

                <p>China's foreign ministry, responding to questions about the military exercises, stated bluntly that "the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair" and advised the Philippines "against using any pretext to draw in external forces." The ministry warned that regional peace was being undermined by "frequent, highly targeted military exercises" and the deployment of American "strategic offensive weapons."</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, Chinese naval forces have been demonstrating their own capabilities. In June, the aircraft carrier Shandong sailed through the Bashi Channel with its battle group to conduct extended exercises in the Western Pacific south of Japan. China's other operational carrier, the Liaoning, simultaneously transited the Miyako Strait northeast of Taiwan for similar drills. These manoeuvres sent a clear message about Beijing's determination to operate freely in Pacific waters.</p>

                <h2>A Community Living with War Preparations</h2>

                <p>For the people of Batanes, these geopolitical calculations translate into very real anxieties. When the 2023 exercises began, residents rushed to stockpile rice, oil, sugar, and milk. The islands depend almost entirely on regular shipments from the mainland, and the prospect of war means the prospect of isolation and starvation.</p>

                <p>Governor Ronald "Jun" Aguto has been working to calm his constituents while simultaneously preparing for the worst. One of his priorities is updating the provincial contingency plan to handle a potential mass influx of overseas Filipino workers from Taiwan. About 200,000 Filipinos work in Taiwan, and in a conflict scenario, many would attempt to flee to the nearest land—which happens to be Batanes.</p>

                <p>"One scenario in our contingency plan is to use Batanes as a launch pad to bring home OFWs from Taiwan," Aguto explained. "But our islands are designed to support 20,000 people. We have to bring them back to the mainland where their sustainability will be more realistic."</p>

                <p>The military is preparing for even more complex scenarios. Retired Commodore Edward Ike De Sagon, the former Philippine Navy commander for Northern Luzon and a Batanes native, told Reuters the military was working with other agencies to manage not just Filipino workers but "possibly refugees from Taiwan and other nationalities."</p>

                <p>History weighs heavily on local minds. Hours after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Japanese troops from Taiwan landed on Batanes' main island as part of their successful campaign to drive American forces from the Philippines. Then, as now, the islands represented a strategic prize worth fighting for.</p>

                <p>Florencio Abad, a former federal budget secretary and member of one of Batanes' most prominent families, has been pressing Manila for clearer contingency plans. "I'm not even thinking about livelihood," the 71-year-old told Reuters from his hilltop home overlooking the Pacific. "I'm just thinking about surviving a war that is so close to us. Even if we do not get directly involved, we may have to take precautions. What if it is not possible to travel by sea or travel by air? How do we feed ourselves?"</p>

                <p>Store owner Hubalde has her own survival plan: encouraging locals to return to growing their own food on the islands' rich volcanic soil. "We really need to start planting," she said simply.</p>

                <h2>What This Means for New Zealand</h2>

                <p>For New Zealanders, these developments in the northern Philippines might seem distant, but they're unfolding in our broader Pacific neighbourhood. The strategic competition between the United States and China is fundamentally reshaping the security environment in a region where New Zealand has deep historical, economic, and people-to-people ties.</p>

                <p>A conflict over Taiwan, which President Xi Jinping has refused to rule out using force to control, would inevitably draw in much of the Asia-Pacific region. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. acknowledged this reality in August: "We do not want to go to war, but I think if there is a war over Taiwan, we will be drawn kicking and screaming, we will be drawn and dragged into that mess."</p>

                <p>The same could be said, to varying degrees, for other nations in the region. New Zealand's security relationships, trade dependencies, and geographical position in the Pacific mean we cannot be insulated from a major conflict involving the world's two largest economies and most powerful militaries.</p>

                <p>The preparations unfolding in Batanes represent a broader pattern of military positioning and alliance-strengthening across the Pacific. Japan is bolstering its defensive capabilities. Australia is deepening its security cooperation with the United States. And smaller Pacific nations are being courted by both Washington and Beijing as they seek strategic advantage.</p>

                <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

                <p>What's clear from Reuters' investigation is that the relatively peaceful post-Cold War era in the Pacific is giving way to something more uncertain and potentially dangerous. The Bashi Channel, once a quiet shipping lane, has become a focal point where the aspirations and anxieties of great powers intersect.</p>

                <p>Whether these extensive military preparations serve as an effective deterrent or whether they increase the risk of miscalculation and conflict remains one of the most consequential questions facing our region. For the people of Batanes, caught at the centre of these strategic calculations, the preparations for war have become part of daily life. For the rest of us in the Pacific, their experience serves as a reminder that the abstract language of geopolitics has very human consequences.</p>

                <p>As tensions continue to simmer and military preparations intensify, the narrow waterway of the Bashi Channel has emerged as a crucial pressure point that could help determine whether the 21st century in our region will be characterised by peace or conflict.</p>
