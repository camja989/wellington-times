            <div class="article-body">
                <p class="lead"><em>Wellington, 24 October 2025</em> - Russian President Vladimir Putin has brushed off new American sanctions targeting his country's two largest oil companies, despite the move sending global oil prices up 5% and prompting major buyers to back away from Russian crude.</p>

                <p>US President Donald Trump announced sanctions on oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil on Wednesday, in a dramatic reversal after saying just last week he'd soon meet Putin in Budapest to negotiate an end to the Ukraine war. The two companies together produce more than 5% of the world's oil.</p>

                <p>The sanctions have already had immediate effects, with Chinese state oil companies suspending Russian oil purchases in the short term, and Indian refiners - the biggest buyers of Russian crude shipped by sea - preparing to sharply cut imports.</p>

                <h2>Putin Defiant</h2>
                
                <p>Speaking in Moscow, Putin dismissed the sanctions as ineffective, saying Russia wouldn't bow to pressure.</p>

                <div class="expert-quote" style="background: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #d32f2f; padding: 20px; margin: 25px 0; border-radius: 4px;">
                    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.7; font-style: italic;">"This is, of course, an attempt to put pressure on Russia. But no self-respecting country and no self-respecting people ever decides anything under pressure."</p>
                    <p style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold; color: #c62828;">â€” Vladimir Putin, Russian President</p>
                </div>

                <p>He warned that cutting Russian supply would push up global prices and cause discomfort for countries including the United States.</p>

                <p>Trump responded later: "I'm glad he feels that way. That's good. I'll let you know about it in six months from now."</p>

                <h2>Summit Cancelled</h2>

                <p>The sanctions mark yet another policy flip-flop from Trump on the Ukraine conflict. He announced he'd cancelled the planned Putin summit because it "just didn't feel right."</p>

                <p>"It didn't feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I cancelled it, but we'll do it in the future," Trump told reporters at the White House.</p>

                <p>Putin suggested the summit had merely been postponed. The two leaders last met in Alaska in August.</p>

                    <ul style="line-height: 1.9; margin: 15px 0;">
                        <li><strong>Oil Price Jump:</strong> Global oil prices rose 5% following the sanctions announcement</li>
                        <li><strong>Companies Targeted:</strong> Rosneft and Lukoil, producing 5%+ of world's oil</li>
                        <li><strong>Chinese Response:</strong> State oil companies suspended short-term Russian purchases</li>
                        <li><strong>Indian Impact:</strong> Major buyers preparing to sharply cut Russian crude imports</li>
                        <li><strong>War Duration:</strong> Now in its fourth year of full-scale fighting</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>Ukraine Seeks More Pressure</h2>

                <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed the sanctions as "very important" but said more pressure would be needed to force Moscow to agree to a ceasefire.</p>

                <p>The conflict continues to grind on, now in its fourth year of full-scale fighting. Russia has made clear it opposes a ceasefire, viewing it as a temporary pause that would simply give Ukraine time to rearm.</p>

                <p>Putin also issued a stark warning about Ukraine's requests for long-range missiles from Western allies, saying Moscow's response to strikes deep into Russian territory would be "very serious, if not overwhelming."</p>

                <h2>European Action</h2>

                <p>Meanwhile, European Union leaders meeting in Brussels agreed to fund Ukraine's needs for the next two years, though they stopped short of endorsing a plan to use frozen Russian assets for a large loan to Kyiv after Belgium raised concerns.</p>

                <p>The EU also adopted its 19th package of Russia sanctions, including a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports and targeting Chinese refiners and Central Asian banks.</p>

                <p>Despite cutting its reliance on Russian energy by roughly 90% since 2022, the EU still imported more than â‚¬11 billion of Russian energy in the first eight months of this year.</p>

                <h2>Impact on Russia</h2>

                <p>Russian oil and gas revenue - currently down 21% year-on-year - accounts for around a quarter of Moscow's budget and remains the most important source of cash for funding the war.</p>

                <p>However, because Russia's main revenue comes from taxing production rather than exports, the immediate financial impact of the sanctions may be somewhat softened.</p>

                <div style="background: #fff3e0; border: 2px solid #ff9800; padding: 20px; margin: 30px 0; border-radius: 8px;">
                    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">
                        <strong>ðŸ’° Economic Impact:</strong> Russian oil and gas revenue is down 21% year-on-year but still accounts for approximately 25% of Moscow's budget. The EU has cut Russian energy reliance by 90% since 2022, yet still imported over â‚¬11 billion in Russian energy in the first eight months of 2025.
