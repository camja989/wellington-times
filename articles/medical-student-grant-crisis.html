            <div class="article-body">
                <p class="lead">Picture this: It's 3 AM in Wellington Hospital. A final year medical student – let's call her Sarah – is halfway through a 16-hour shift. She's checking on patients, updating charts, and providing essential care alongside the doctors and nurses you trust with your life. In six months, she'll be the doctor you see in ED when your child has a fever that won't break.</p>

                <p>But right now, she's calculating whether she can afford both petrol to get to the hospital tomorrow and groceries for the week. The answer, increasingly, is no.</p>

                <h2>Working Full-Time for Poverty Wages</h2>

                <p>Final year medical students in New Zealand aren't sitting in lecture halls. They're in our hospitals, working 40-60 hour weeks providing real patient care. They're the extra hands that help overwhelmed departments function. They're learning, yes, but they're also working – performing physical examinations, taking patient histories, assisting in surgeries, and being integral members of healthcare teams.</p>

                <p>Their compensation? A trainee intern grant that hasn't increased a single cent since 2006.</p>

                <p>Let that sink in. While your rent has doubled, while a block of cheese costs $15, while petrol prices have soared, these future doctors are receiving the exact same amount their predecessors got when the iPhone didn't exist and a flat white cost $3.</p>

                <h2>The Mathematics of Impossibility</h2>

                <p>In 2006, the average rent in Wellington was $280 per week. Today? Try $650. The grant these students receive doesn't even cover basic accommodation, let alone food, transport, or the professional clothing required for hospital work. Many are accumulating additional debt just to survive their final year – on top of the $80,000-100,000 student loan they're already carrying.</p>

                <p>I've watched classmates skip meals to save money. I've seen brilliant future doctors working night shifts at supermarkets after finishing 12-hour days at the hospital, jeopardising their learning and patient safety through exhaustion. I know students who've moved back with parents hours away, commuting impossible distances because they simply cannot afford to live near their hospital placements.</p>

                <p>This isn't just unfair – it's dangerous.</p>

                <h2>When Doctors Can't Afford to Become Doctors</h2>

                <p>Here's what should terrify every New Zealander: we're creating a system where only the wealthy can afford to complete medical training.</p>

                <p>Working-class students, Māori and Pasifika students, rural students – those who often have the deepest understanding of our most vulnerable communities' health needs – are being priced out of medicine. When Sarah, our 3 AM medical student, comes from a family that can't provide financial support, she faces an impossible choice: abandon her dream of serving her community or sink deeper into poverty.</p>

                <p>We talk about our doctor shortage as if it's some mysterious phenomenon. But how can we expect to have enough doctors when we make it financially impossible for students to complete their training?</p>

                <h2>The Ripple Effect You'll Feel</h2>

                <p>This isn't just about fairness for students. This is about your healthcare.</p>

                <p>Exhausted, financially stressed medical students make mistakes. They burn out before they even graduate. They look across the Tasman, where Australian hospitals offer better conditions and their dollar stretches further, and they leave. Every medical student we lose to financial pressure is one less doctor in our hospitals, one longer wait time in ED, one more community without a GP.</p>

                <p>We've invested hundreds of thousands in training each medical student. To lose them in their final year because we won't adjust a grant for inflation isn't just cruel – it's economically idiotic.</p>

                <h2>The Human Cost Behind the Statistics</h2>

                <p>Last month, a classmate broke down in tears in the hospital bathroom. Not because of a difficult case or the pressure of learning – but because her car had broken down and she couldn't afford to fix it. Without it, she couldn't get to her rural placement. She was weeks away from graduating, from finally earning a doctor's salary and serving the community that desperately needed her. But those last weeks seemed insurmountable.</p>

                <p>This is the reality of 2024: future doctors choosing between textbooks and food, between attending crucial training and working shifts to pay rent. These aren't entitled kids asking for handouts. These are dedicated individuals who've worked incredibly hard for six years, who are providing essential services in our hospitals right now, who just need enough support to cross the finish line.</p>

                <h2>A Simple Ask with Profound Impact</h2>

                <p>We're not asking for luxury. We're asking for the same purchasing power students had in 2006. Adjusting the trainee intern grant for inflation isn't generous – it's the bare minimum of fairness.</p>

                <p>This affects every single New Zealander. When you're waiting months for a specialist appointment, when your local GP practice closes because they can't find doctors, when you're sitting in ED for hours – remember that we had the chance to fix part of this problem, and it would have cost less than we spend on consultants' reports about the health crisis.</p>

                <h2>Your Voice Matters</h2>

                <p>The government listens when voters speak. Every signature on the petition, every letter to an MP, every conversation that shifts this from a "student issue" to a "healthcare crisis" matters.</p>

                <p>These medical students aren't asking you to solve their problems. They're working themselves to exhaustion to become the doctors you'll need. They're just asking that we don't make it impossible for them to finish what they started.</p>

                <p>Because when Sarah finally breaks under the financial pressure and leaves medicine, it won't just be her dreams that shatter. It'll be one more crack in a healthcare system that we all depend on to keep us alive.</p>

                <p>The question isn't whether we can afford to increase the trainee intern grant. It's whether we can afford not to.</p>
