## üöÄ CRITICAL STEPS YOU MUST DO NOW

### Step 1: Point wellingtontimes.co.nz to Your Hosting
1. Log into your domain registrar where you bought wellingtontimes.co.nz
2. Find DNS settings
3. Add these records (copy from your wgtnews.live DNS):
   - **A Record**: Point `@` to your hosting IP
   - **A Record**: Point `www` to your hosting IP
   - Or if using CNAME, point to your hosting provider

### Step 2: Upload These Files to wellingtontimes.co.nz
Once DNS is pointing correctly:
1. Upload ALL your website files to wellingtontimes.co.nz hosting
2. Make sure the new `.htaccess` is uploaded
3. Test that `https://wellingtontimes.co.nz` works

### Step 3: Set Up 301 Redirects from wgtnews.live
**SUPER IMPORTANT** - You need to keep wgtnews.live and redirect it to the new domain:

1. On your **wgtnews.live hosting**, create/replace the `.htaccess` file with this content:
   ```apache
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^wgtnews\.live$ [NC,OR]
   RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.wgtnews\.live$ [NC]
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://wellingtontimes.co.nz/$1 [R=301,L]
   ```
   
   I've saved this in `WGTNEWS_LIVE_HTACCESS.txt` - just copy it to `.htaccess` on wgtnews.live

### Step 4: Get SSL Certificates for BOTH Domains
- wellingtontimes.co.nz needs SSL (HTTPS)
- wgtnews.live needs SSL (for the redirect)
- Use Let's Encrypt (free) or your hosting provider

### Step 5: Submit to Google Search Console
1. **Add NEW property**: wellingtontimes.co.nz
   - Verify ownership
   - Submit sitemap: https://wellingtontimes.co.nz/sitemap.xml
   - Request indexing for homepage

2. **Keep OLD property**: wgtnews.live
   - In Google Search Console
   - Go to "Change of address" tool
   - Tell Google you moved to wellingtontimes.co.nz
   - This transfers SEO authority!

### Step 6: Update Google My Business (if you have it)
- Change website URL to wellingtontimes.co.nz

### Step 7: Update Social Media
- Facebook page: Update website URL
- Any other social profiles

### Step 8: Update Any Existing Links
